What is Ngram?
An n-gram model is a type of probabilistic model for predicting the next item in a sequence.
n-grams are used in various areas of statistical natural language processing and genetic sequence analysis.
An n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence.
The items in question can be phonemes, syllables, letters, words or base pairs according to the application.
An n-gram of size 1 is referred to as a "unigram"; size 2 is a "bigram" (or, less commonly, a "digram");
size 3 is a "trigram"; and size 4 or more is simply called an "n-gram".
